A platform for P2P resource distrobution. Everything for everyone, no questions asked.

## Running Locally

### Install Packages

### Setup Firebase

#### `firebase login`

Connect to dev project.

*Request permission from repo owner for project access.*

### Run

*Local environment variables from the firebase project are needed to run. Request from owner.*

#### `npm start`

This will start the app and connect to the firebase dev project. Run firestore & auth emulators to run locally.

### Test

**Test firestore rules:**

#### `npm run test-firestore`

**Test React app:**

#### `npm run test-react-app`

**Update Firestore Data**

Changes to firestore data must be constructed programmatically using `populate.test.ts`
in the test/firebase directory. After building the desired test data export wit the following command and commit both to git.

#### `firebase --project demo-project emulators:start --only firestore,auth,storage --import src/test/firebase`

This starts the emulator with the current data. To make changes to firebase, do so programmatically by updating `populate.test.ts`. For the other emulators, do so manually. When finished, export with:

#### `firebase --project demo-project emulators:export src/test/firebase`
